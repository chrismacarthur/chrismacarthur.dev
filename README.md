# chrismacarthur.dev
chrismacarthur.dev is my custom-built website, acting as a personal portfolio for the various projects I've worked on.

## Accessing the Domain
The website is accessible over the HTTPS protocol: [https://chrismacarthur.dev](https://chrismacarthur.dev).

## The Stack
* React.js
    - Babel
* Express.js
* Node.js

#### React.js
React.js components written in JSX (JavaScript Syntax Extension) are used for the front end content of the website. These components dynamically construct and collapse the site's DOM (Document Object Model), enabling the Single-Page Application structure.

#### Babel
Before our JSX React components can be interpreted by a browser, they need to be converted to standard JavaScript. Babel is a transpiler that compiles our JSX components into their plain JavaScript equivalents so they can be understood and executed.

#### Express.js
Express.js is a Node.js framework that initiates our server, serving files and routing URLs.

#### Node.js
At the base of this application is Node.js, a JavaScript runtime environment. This is what allows for the continuous serving of JavaScript code.

## Development Disclaimer: The Site is Down, What Gives?
If you've attempted to access the domain but weren't served with a webpage, it's probably because I'm performing maintenance on the server. This project is still heavily "in the works", so if you were unable to visit the site, check back soon!
